# tsslope-siml


## Description
We provide HPC workflows in Python drivers to generate training data generated by TS simulator to train TS ML models. These workflows are based on existing software libraries, such as [libEnsemble](https://github.com/Libensemble/libensemble) for handling a large number of ensembles of simulations (that is, TS simulations) on massively parallel HPC platforms. At this moment tsslope-siml allows  simulating TS  using PowerWorld. Interfacing with ANDES is under consideration.

tsslope-siml also  provides Python scripts that train a ML model to learn  TS measures, such as TS indexes (which are integrated in optimization models using  `tsslope-pump`). 


Directories:
  - tbd1: library that contains functions to load the ML model and some parameters
  - test: contains test code
